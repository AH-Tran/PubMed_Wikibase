There are three major types: 1, Eosinophilic fasciitis, an inflammatory reaction with eosinophilia, producing hard thickened skin with an orange-peel configuration suggestive of scleroderma and considered by some a variant of scleroderma; 2, Necrotizing fasciitis (FASCIITIS, NECROTIZING), a serious fulminating infection (usually by a beta hemolytic streptococcus) causing extensive necrosis of superficial fascia; 3, Nodular/Pseudosarcomatous /Proliferative fasciitis, characterized by a rapid growth of fibroblasts with mononuclear inflammatory cells and proliferating capillaries in soft tissue, often the forearm; it is not malignant but is sometimes mistaken for fibrosarcoma.",https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D005208
163,D036981,"Fasciitis, Plantar","Inflammation of the plantar fascia (APONEUROSIS) on the bottom of the foot causing heel pain. The etiology of plantar fasciitis remains controversial but is likely to involve a biomechanical imbalance. Though often presenting along with HEEL SPUR, they do not appear to be causally related.",https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D036981
167,D018746,Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome,"A systemic inflammatory response to a variety of clinical insults, characterized by two or more of the following conditions: (1) fever >38 degrees C or HYPOTHERMIA <36 degrees C; (2) TACHYCARDIA >90 beat/minute; (3) tachypnea >24 breaths/minute; (4) LEUKOCYTOSIS >12,000 cells/cubic mm or 10% immature forms. While usually related to infection, SIRS can also be associated with noninfectious insults such as TRAUMA; BURNS; or PANCREATITIS. If infection is involved, a patient with SIRS is said to have SEPSIS.",https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D018746
168,D000071199,"NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein",An NLR protein that contains an N-terminal PYRIN DOMAIN and ATP-binding site and 9 C-terminal LEUCINE-rich repeats; it is expressed primarily by MACROPHAGES. It is a core component of the INFLAMMASOME and directs its assembly in response to pathogen infection and damage-associated stimuli. Mutations in the NLRP3 gene are associated with FAMILIAL COLD AUTOINFLAMMATORY SYNDROME.,https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000071199
